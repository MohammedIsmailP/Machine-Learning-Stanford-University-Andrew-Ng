[Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng) is Founder of DeepLearning.AI, General Partner at AI Fund, Chairman and Co-Founder of Coursera, and an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University. As a pioneer both in machine learning and online education, Dr. Ng has changed countless lives through his work in AI, authoring or co-authoring over 100 research papers in machine learning, robotics, and related fields. Previously, he was chief scientist at Baidu, the founding lead of the Google Brain team. Dr. Ng now focuses his time primarily on his entrepreneurial ventures, looking for the best ways to accelerate responsible AI practices in the larger global economy.

## Topics covered

This course provides a broad introduction to Machine learning, Data mining, and Statistical pattern recognition.
1. Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
2. Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
3. Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory, innovation process in machine learning and AI).

## Syllabus

### Week 1 : Introduction, Linear Regression and Linear Algebra

This module introduces us to the core concept of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data — without being explicitly programmed. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on input value with the help of notions like Cost function and Gradient descent. The optional Linear algebra module provides a refreshments on the basic understanding of linear algebra concepts.

### Week 2 : Linear Regression with Multiple Variables and Octave/Matlab Tutorial

This module shows us how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. Discuss best practices for implementing linear regression. This module also includes programming assignments designed to help us understand, how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, we are required to make use of Octave or MATLAB. This module also introduces us short tutorial on Octave/Matlab to complete the assignment.
